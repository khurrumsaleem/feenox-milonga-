# How FeenoX works

> **Heads up!** First things first:
>
> 1. [FeenoX](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox) is not a traditional point-and-click finite-element solver. It **does not include** a graphical interface.
> 
> 2. FeenoX is designed as a [cloud-first](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#cloud-first) [back end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend) for generic computational workflows. One of these many workflows can be point-and-click graphical interface such as [CAEplex](https://www.caeplex.com) which allows to solve thermo-mechanical problems directly from the browser.
>
> 3. Since it is a cloud-first tool, FeenoX targets at GNU/Linux. If you are using Windows, FeenoX may not be for you (but [CAEplex](https://www.caeplex.com) may). See below to find out [why](#why) FeenoX works the way it does.


In plain engineering terms, FeenoX works like a transfer function between one or more input files and zero or more output files:

```include
doc/transfer.md
```

When solving problems using the finite element method, FeenoX sits in the middle of pre and post-processing tools.
The former should aid the engineer to prepare the mesh and, eventually, the input file.
The latter should show the numerical results. See the [tensile test tutorial](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/tutorials/110-tensile-test/) for an in-depth step-by-step explanation.

To fix ideas, let us consider the [NAFEMSÂ LE10 "Thick plate pressure" benchmark](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/examples/mechanical.html#nafems-le10-thick-plate-pressure-benchmark). @Fig:nafems-le10 shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the human-friendly problem formulation and the input file FeenoX reads.

![The NAFEMS LE10 problem statement and the corresponding FeenoX input](nafems-le10-problem-input.svg){#fig:nafems-le10 width=100% }

Say we already have a [`nafems-le10.geo`](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/blob/main/examples/nafems-le10.geo) file which tells [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) how to create a mesh `nafems-le10.msh` (check out the [tensile test tutorial](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/tutorials/110-tensile-test/) for details).
Then, we can create an input file for FeenoX (using [editors with syntax highlighting](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#syntactic-sugar-highlighting) for example) as follows:

```feenox
PROBLEM mechanical 3D
READ_MESH nafems-le10.msh   # mesh in millimeters

# LOADING: uniform normal pressure on the upper surface
BC upper    p=1      # 1 Mpa

# BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:
BC DCD'C'   v=0      # Face DCD'C' zero y-displacement
BC ABA'B'   u=0      # Face ABA'B' zero x-displacement
BC BCB'C'   u=0 v=0  # Face BCB'C' x and y displ. fixed
BC midplane w=0      #  z displacements fixed along mid-plane

# MATERIAL PROPERTIES: isotropic single-material properties
E = 210e3   # Young modulus in MPa
nu = 0.3    # Poisson's ratio

SOLVE_PROBLEM   # solve!

# print the direct stress y at D (and nothing more)
PRINT "sigma_y @ D = " sigmay(2000,0,300) "MPa"
```

Once we put these two files, `nafems-le10.geo` and `nafems-le10.fee` in the same directory, we call first Gmsh and then FeenoX from the terminal to solve the benchmark problem:

```{=html}
<div id="cast-le10"></div>
<script>AsciinemaPlayer.create('doc/le10.cast', document.getElementById('cast-le10'), {cols:133,rows:32, poster: 'npt:0:3'});</script>
```

The trick is that this workflow is susceptible of being automated and customized to run in the cloud, possibly in parallel throughout several servers using the MPI standard.

There is a sound explanation about [why FeenoX works this way](#why) and not like other FEA tools you might have encountered in the past. If you are feeling curious, take a look at what FeenoX has to offer to [hackers](README4hackers.md) and [academics](README4academics.md).


# What can FeenoX solve

FeenoX can solve the following types of problems:

```include
doc/examples-list.md
```

Take the tutorials to learn how to solve those types of problems:
 
```include
doc/tutorials-list.md
```
 
Browse through [the documentation](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/) to dive deeper into the details.
 
# Why

There are two "why" questions we have to answer.

 1. Why is FeenoX different from other "similar" tools?
 
    Consider again the NAFEMS LE10 case from @fig:nafems-le10 above.
    Take some time and think (or investigate) how other FEA tools handle this case.
    Note the following features FeenoX provides:
    
     * ready-to-run executable (no need to compile)
     * self-explanatory plain-text near-English input file
       - one-to-one correspondence between computer input file and human description of the problem
       - Git-traceable (mesh is not part of the input file)
       - everything is an expression
         - material properties can be given as functions of space and/or time and/or temperature (or other intermediate variables)
         - these functions can be given as algebraic expresions or come from interpolateed point-wise defined data
     * 100% user-defined output
     * simple problems need simple inputs
     * similar problems need similar inputs
     * parametric and optimization runs through command-line arguments
     * flexibility to handle many workflows, including [web-based interfaces](https://www.caeplex.com)

 2. Why FeenoX works the way it does?
 
    Because it is [cloud first](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#cloud-first) and its objective is to be flexible enough to power web-based interfaces like [CAEplex](https://www.caeplex.com) and many other workflows.
    More information in the details for [Unix experts](README4hackers.md) and [professors](README4academics.md).
    
    Depending on the complexity of the case, [CAEplex](https://www.caeplex.com) might be enough or not.
    If the latter, one has to see what's sitting under the hood.
    Peek into [the documentation](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/) and [the repository](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/) for further details.
