General things to do

-   use spack
-   https://joss.theoj.org/
-   FIT to mesh-based functions
-   FIT taking into account uncertainties
-   extended integration (as in reduced, full, extended)
-   analyze memory overcommit
-   allow PETSc configured with --download-slepc
-   insert expansion mpicc into feenox -V

Tests

-   move all doc/examples to tests
-   automated nightly builds and tests (Laminar CI?)
-   write a README and an explanation of each test
-   make an index of the keywords used in each test and link them from
    the doc as examples
-   cell-based mesh writes and integrations
-   FIT ranges

Wasora keywords

-   SEMAPHORE + SHARED_MEMORY
-   READ / WRITE
-   SOLVE
-   M4 (MUSTACHE? MACRO?)
-   SHELL
-   HISTORY
-   PRINT_FUNCTION PHYSICAL_ENTITY
-   CALL user routines (check hash of feenox.h)

Wasora-like stuff

-   vector & matrix assignements & DAEs
-   debug mode, line-by-line
-   trap signit & sigterm

API

-   Python?
-   Julia?
-   come up with an example in C

Nice to have

-   logaritmic ranges for PRINT_FUNCTION
-   default separator after TEXT should be space, after numerical should
    be tab
-   PRINTF instruction
-   PRINT_FUNCTION with %f in between arguments (like PRINT_VECTOR)
-   BLAS
    -   BLAS a * b = s   # scalar dot
    -   BLAS a x b = c   # vector cross
    -   BLAS A * b = c   # matrix-vector
    -   BLAS a + b = c   # vector
    -   BLAS A + B = C   # matrix
    -   BLAS a - b = c
    -   BLAS A - B = C

Command-line arguments

-   list symbols with -l (is there any clash with petsc?)
-   $1 = ${1}
-   $0 should have the main input file basename (without the extension)

Error handling

-   GSL error handling
-   feenox_nan_error()
-   feenox_gsl_handler()

Postprocessing output

-   symmetric & full tensors
-   vtu format
-   frd? (to be able to use ccx’s post processor… is it worth it?)
-   binary msh and vtk
-   msh v4.1
-   support CGNS formats
-   MED
-   problem-aware WRITE_POST
    -   full | displacements | stresses | strains | von_mises | tresca | principal
    -   full | temperature | heat_flux
    -   full | mode_1 | mode_n1 | modes
    -   full | flux_1 | fluxes | currents
    -   implicit call to SOLVE_PROBLEM?

Extensions

-   mustache instead of m4
-   gmsh as a library? maybe not, just import both gmsh and feenox in
    Python and use them together
-   use dmplex?

PDEs

-   check when the matrices do not need to be rebuilt – use constant
    flag
-   allow different material model for each volume!
    -   so far we have a global material model, i.e. all the materials
        have to be orthotropic
    -   this is wrong!
-   remove the need of needing an explicit SOLVE_PROBLEM
    -   detect which variables/functions are PDE outputs and call
        solve_problem() the first time they are needed
-   benchmark MPI

Laplace/Poisson/Helmholtz

-   poisson f = 1, eta = 0
-   helmholtz f = 1, eta = 1
-   see 2D example in Gmsh list

Heat

-   parallel runs
-   convection with a separate matrix? think!
-   jacobians for non-linear problems
-   explain that radiation is better off as an expression
-   same for total heat sources/bcs
-   orthotropic conductivity

Mechanical

-   non-linear
-   stresses: count negative jacobians and worst jacobians
-   stress linearization (per-problem parser)
-   strain energy (global and local)

Modal

-   partially-unconstrained DOFs

Neutron

-   transport
-   FVM
-   benchmarks

V & V

-   MMS
