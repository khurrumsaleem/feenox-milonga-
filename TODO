General things to TODO

Binaries

-   automate the generation of binary tarballs
    -   –with-fc=0 –with-cxx=0 –with-c2html=0

Wasora keywords

-   SEMAPHORE

-   READ / WRITE

-   PRINT_VECTOR

-   SOLVE

-   M4 (MUSTACHE? MACRO?)

-   SHELL

-   HISTORY

-   PARAMETRIC

-   FIT

-   MINIMIZE

-   explain that

    -   nouns -> definitions
    -   verbs -> instructions

Wasora stuff

-   non-topology pointwise functions
    -   derivative of a column with respect to another one as a UNIX
        filter
-   vector & matrix assignements & DAEs
-   debug mode, line-by-line

API

-   Python?
-   Julia?

Nice to have

-   logaritmic ranges for PRINT_FUNCTION
-   default separator after TEXT is space, after numerical is tab
-   BLAS
    -   BLAS a * b = s # scalar dot
    -   BLAS a x b = c # vector cross
    -   BLAS A * b = c # matrix-vector
    -   BLAS a + b = c # vector
    -   BLAS A + B = C # matrix
    -   BLAS a - b = c
    -   BLAS A - B = C

Command-line arguments

-   list symbols with “-l” (is there any clash with petsc?)
-   $1 = ${1}
-   explain PETSc’s options, use double-dashes
    -   –ksp_view
    -   –ksp_monitor
    -   –pc_type lu
    -   –pc_type ilu
    -   –pc_type jacobi
-   MUMPS

Error handling

-   gsl error handling
-   feenox_nan_error()
-   feenox_gsl_handler()

Postprocessing output

-   symmetric & full tensors
-   vtu format
-   frd? (to be able to use ccx’s post processor… is it worth it?)
-   problem-aware WRITE_POST
    -   FULL | DISPLACEMENTS | STRESS | STRAIN | VON_MISES | TRESCA |
        PRINCIPAL
    -   FULL | TEMPERATURE | HEAT_FLUX
    -   FULL | MODES
    -   FULL | FLUX(ES) | CURRENT(S)

Extensions

-   mustache instead of m4
-   gmsh as a library?

PDEs

-   check when the matrices do not need to be rebuilt
-   keep K_original and K_with_bc or whatever?
-   support CGNS formats

Heat

-   convection with a separate matrix? think!
-   jacobians for non-linear problems
-   explain that radiation is better off as an expression
-   same for total heat sources/bcs
-   reactions (i.e. total power through faces)
-   heat flux as secondary field
-   orthotropic conductivity
-   total power sources and BCs (can’t we get away with the
    volumes/areas as variables?)
-   transient

Mechanical

-   everything
-   stresses

Modal

-   everything
-   deflate null space without BCs

Neutron

-   diffusion
-   transport
