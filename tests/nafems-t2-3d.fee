PROBLEM heat

l = 0.1      # slab length in meters (used in the mesh)

k = 55.6                # W/(m K)
# sigma = 5.67e-8       # W m^2 / K^4 as in the problem
sigma = 5.670374419e-8  # as in wikipedia
e = 0.98
T0 = 1000     # K
Tinf = 300    # K

BC left  T=T0
BC right q=sigma*e*(Tinf^4-T(x,y,z)^4)

SOLVE_PROBLEM

VAR T'
T_analytical = root((T'-T0)*k/l + sigma*e*(T'^4-Tinf^4), T', 0, 2000, 1e-12)

PRINT T(0.1,0,0)-T_analytical
