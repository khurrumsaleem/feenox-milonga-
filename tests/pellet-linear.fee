# pellet radius in m
r = 4e-3


# uniform conductivity (i.e. linear problem)
k = 2.8

# uniform volumetric heat power starting from linear power density = 300 W / cm
# q is in W / m^3 = 300 W/cm * 100 cm/m / area
q = 300 * 100 / (pi*r^2)
# PRINT q

BC symmetry adiabatic

# analytical solution
T_ref = 420 + q/(4*k)*r^2
