Description: cloud-first free no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish) tool
 FeenoX is a computational engineering tool designed to solve
 engineering-related problems using cloud servers in parallel
 in such a way that the problem is defined in a plain-text
 near-English self descriptive input file read at run time,
 without requiring further user intervention after the invocation.
 .
 So far it can solve 
 .
  * Basic mathematics
  * Systems of ODEs/DAEs
  * Laplaceâ€™s equation
  * Heat conduction
  * Linear elasticity
  * Modal analysis
  * Neutron diffusion
  * Neutron SN
 .
 The usage depends on Gmsh to create the meshes.
 Optionally, FeenoX's output can be post-processed with Paraview.
