FeenoX for Debian
-----------------

FeenoX is a cloud-first free no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish)
computational engineering tool designed to solve engineering-related
problems using cloud servers in parallel in such a way that the problem
is defined in a plain-text near-English self descriptive input file
read at run time, without requiring further user intervention after the
invocation.

So far it can solve 

 * Basic mathematics
 * Systems of ODEs/DAEs
 * Laplaceâ€™s equation
 * Heat conduction
 * Linear elasticity
 * Modal analysis
 * Neutron diffusion
 * Neutron SN

Other PDEs can be added by providing compile-time entry points as C
functions that build the elemental objects. The binary depends on

 * GNU Scientific Library
 * PETSc
 * SLEPc
 
The usage depends on Gmsh to create the meshes.
Optionally, FeenoX's output can be post-processed with Paraview.


The software and its design basis is described in this JOSS paper:
