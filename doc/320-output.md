The output ought to contain useful results and should not be cluttered up with non-mandatory information such as ASCII art, notices, explanations or copyright notices.
Since the time of cognizant engineers is far more expensive than CPU time, output should be easily interpreted by either a human or, even better, by other programs or interfaces---especially those based in mobile and/or web platforms. Open-source formats and standards should be preferred over privative and ad-hoc formatting to encourage the possibility of using different workflows and/or interfaces.
