The tool ought to be able to start solving small problems first to check the inputs and outputs behave as expected and then allow increasing the problem size up in order to achieve to the desired accuracy of the results. As mentioned in [@sec:architecture], large problem should be split among different computers to be able to solve them using a finite amount of per-host computational power (RAM and CPU).
