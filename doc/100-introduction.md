# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

A cloud-based computational tool (herein after referred to as _the tool_) is required in order to solve engineering problems following the current state-of-the-art methods and technologies impacting the high-performance computing world.
This (imaginary but plausible) Software Requirements Specification document describes the mandatory features this tool ought to have and lists some features which would be nice the tool had.
Also it contains requirements and guidelines about architecture, execution and interfaces in order to fulfill the needs of cognizant engineers as of 2021 (and the years to come) are defined. 

On the one hand, the tool should allow to solve industrial problems under stringent efficiency ([@sec:efficiency]) and quality ([@sec:qa]) requirements. It is therefore mandatory to be able to assess the source code for

 * independent verification, and/or
 * performance profiling, and/or
 * quality control
 
by qualified third parties from all around the world, so it has to be _open source_.

On the other hand, the initial version of the tool is expected to provide a basic functionality which might be extended ([@sec:objective] and [@sec:extensibility]) by academic researchers and/or professional programmers. It thus should also be _free_---in the sense of freedom, not in the sense of price. There is no requirement on the pricing scheme.
The detailed licensing terms are left to the offer but it should allow users to solve their problems the way they need and, eventually, to modify and improve the tool to suit their needs. If they cannot program themselves, they should have the _freedom_ to hire somebody to do it for them.
