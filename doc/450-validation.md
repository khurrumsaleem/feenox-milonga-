As with verification, for each industrial application of the tool there should be a documented procedure to perform a set of validation tests, defined as

> The process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model.

i.e. checking that the right equations are being solved by the tool. This procedure should be based on existing industry standards regarding verification and validation such as ASME, AIAA, IAEA, etc. There should be a procedure for each type of physical problem (thermal, mechanical, thermomechanical, nuclear, etc.) and for each problem type when a new

 * geometry,
 * mesh type,
 * material model,
 * boundary condition,
 * data interpolation scheme

or any other particular application-dependent feature is needed.

A report following the validation procedure defined above should be prepared and signed by a responsible engineer in a case-by-case basis for each particular field of application of the tool. Verification can be performed against

 * known analytical results, and/or
 * other already-validated tools following the same standards, and/or
 * experimental results.
