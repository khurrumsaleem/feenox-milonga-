The tool should be able to handle engineering problems involving different materials with potential spatial and time-dependent properties, such as temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficients and/or non-constant densities.
Boundary conditions must be allowed to depend on both space and time as well, like non-uniform pressure loads and/or transient heat fluxes.
