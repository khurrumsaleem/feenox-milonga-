Instructions will be read from standard input if “-” is passed as
inputfile, i.e.

    $ echo 'PRINT 2+2' | feenox -
    4

PETSc and SLEPc options can be passed in [options] as well, with the
difference that two hyphens have to be used instead of only once. For
example, to pass the PETSc option -ksp_view the actual FeenoX invocation
should be

    $ feenox --ksp_view input.fee

The optional [replacement arguments] part of the command line mean that
each argument after the input file that does not start with an hyphen
will be expanded verbatim in the input file in each occurrence of $1,
$2, etc. For example

    $ echo 'PRINT $1+$2' | feenox - 3 4
    7

usage.
