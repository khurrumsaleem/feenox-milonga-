The tool should be able to allow remote execution without any user intervention after the tool is launched.
To achieve this goal it is required that the problem should be completely defined in one or more input files and the output should be complete and useful after the tool finishes its execution, as already required.
The tool should be able to report the status of the execution (i.e. progress, errors, etc.) and to make this information available to the user or process that launched the execution, possibly from a remote location.
