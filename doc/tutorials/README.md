# Introduction

[FeenoX](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox) is a cloud-first engineering tool. This idea is thoroughly discussed in the [documentation](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc), particularly in the

 * [Software Requirements Specification](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/srs.html), and
 * [Software Design Specification](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html)
 
As such, it is a tool that in principle should be used from a higher-level interface (e.g. a web-based UI such as www.caeplex.com) or called from a set of automated scripts following some kind of parametric or optimization workflow. In any case, if you want to learn how to create your web-based interface or how to implement an optimization workflow on your own, you will need to start running simple cases manually and then increasing the complexity until reaching the solve state-of-the-art capabilities. Indeed, it is this the main goal of the tutorials, namely to be able to run relatively small problems in FeenoX by creating the appropriate input files and, eventually meshes or other needed data files.
