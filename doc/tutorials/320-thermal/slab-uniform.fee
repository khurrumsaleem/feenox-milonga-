# ask to solve a thermal problem
PROBLEM thermal 1d

# read the mesh
READ_MESH slab.msh

# conductivity: given as a the k variable means uniform single-material
k = 1

# boundary conditions: T=something means "fixed temperature"
BC left  T=0
BC right T=1

SOLVE_PROBLEM

# the solution is available as the function T(x), which we can
# i. print its definition values
PRINT_FUNCTION T

#  ii. evaluate it at any arbitrary location `x`
PRINT "\# the temperature at x=2/3 is" T(2/3)
