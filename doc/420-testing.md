## Automated testing

A mean to automatically test the code works as expected is mandatory. A set of problems with known solutions should be solved with the tool after each modification of the code to make sure these changes still give the right answers for the right questions and no regressions are introduced. Unit software testing practices like continuous integration and test coverage are recommended.

**static = compiler flags**

**dynamic = valgrind**
