FeenoX is a computational tool that can solve engineering problems which are usually casted as differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs).
It is to finite elements programs and libraries what Markdown is to Word and TeX, respectively.
In particular, it can solve

 * dynamical systems defined by a set of user-provided DAEs (such as plant control dynamics for example)
 * mechanical elasticity
 * heat conduction
 * structural modal analysis
 * neutron diffusion
 * neutron transport

FeenoX reads a plain-text input file which contains the problem definition and writes 100%-user defined results in ASCII (through `PRINT` or other user-defined output instructions within the input file). For PDE problems, it needs a reference to at least one [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) mesh file for the discretization of the domain. It can write post-processing views in either `.msh`, `.vtu` or `.vtk` formats. 

Keep in mind that FeenoX is just a back end reading a set of input files and writing a set of output files following the design philosophy of Unix (separation, composition, representation, economy, extensibility, etc). Think of it as a transfer function (or a filter in computer-science jargon) between input files and output files:

```include
transfer.md
```

Following the Unix programming philosophy, there are no graphical interfaces attached to the FeenoX core, although a wide variety of pre and post-processors can be used with FeenoX. To illustrate the transfer-function approach, consider the following input file that solves Laplaceâ€™s equation $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$ on a square with some space-dependent boundary conditions:

```include
laplace.md
```

The `.msh` file can be post-processed with [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/), and the `.vtu`/`.vtk` file can be post-processed with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).
