Documentation should be complete and cover both the user and the developer point of view. It should include a user manual adequate for both reference and tutorial purposes. Other forms of simplified documentation such as quick reference cards or video tutorials are not mandatory but highly recommended. Since the tool should be extendable (@sec:extensibility), there should be a separate development manual covering the programming design and implementation, explaining how to extend the code and how to add new features.
Also, as non-trivial mathematics which should be verified (@sec:verification) are expected, a thorough explanation of what equations are taken into account and how they are solved is required.

It should be possible to make the full documentation available online in a way that it can be both printed in hard copy and accessed easily from a mobile device. Users modifying the tool to suit their own needs should be able to modify the associated documentation as well, so a clear notice about the licensing terms of the documentation itself (which might be different from the licensing terms of the source code itself) is mandatory. Tracking changes in the documentation should be similar to tracking changes in the code base. 
Each individual document ought to explicitly state to which version of the tool applies. 
Plain ASCII formats should be preferred.
It is forbidden to submit documentation in a non-free format. 

The documentation shall also include procedures for

 * reporting errors and bugs
 * releasing stable versions
 * performing verification and validation studies
 * contributing to the code base, including
   * code of conduct
   * coding styles
   * variable and function naming conventions
