and $\sigma=10$, $r=28$ and $b=8/3$, which are the classical parameters that generate the butterfly as presented by Edward Lorenz back in his seminal 1963 paper [Deterministic non-periodic flow](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2).

The following ASCII input file ressembles the parameters, inital conditions and differential equations of the problem as naturally as possible:

```{.feenox include="lorenz.fee"}
```

Indeed, when executing FeenoX with this input file, we get four ASCII columns ($t$, $x$, $y$ and $z$) which we can then redirect to a file and plot it with a standard tool such as Gnuplot. Note the importance of relying on plain ASCII text  formats both for input and output, as recommended by the UNIX philosophy and the _rule of composition_: other programs can easily create inputs for FeenoX and other programs can easily understand FeenoX' outputs. This is essentially how UNIX filters and pipes work.
