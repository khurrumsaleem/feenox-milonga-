# linear temperature gradient in the radial and axial direction
T(x,y,z) = (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) + z

# Boundary conditions
BC xz     symmetry
BC yz     symmetry
BC xy     w=0
BC HIH'I' w=0

# material properties (isotropic & uniform so we can use scalar constants)
E = 210e3*1e6       # mesh is in meters, so E=210e3 MPa -> Pa
nu = 0.3            # dimensionless
alpha = 2.3e-4      # in 1/ÂºC as in the problem
