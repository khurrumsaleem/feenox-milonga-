# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

A computational tool (herein after referred to as _the tool_) is required in order to solve engineering problems.
This (imaginary but plausible) Software Requirements Specification document describes the mandatory features the tool ought to have and lists some features which would be nice the tool had.
Also it contains requirements and guidelines about architecture, execution and interfaces in order to fulfill the needs of cognizant engineers as of 2021 (and the years to come) are defined. 

On the one hand, the tool should be applicable to solving industrial problems under stringent efficiency ([@sec:efficiency]) and quality ([@sec:qa]) requirements. It is therefore mandatory to be able to assess the source code for potential performance and verification revision by qualified third parties from all around the world. On the other hand, the initial version of the tool is expected to be a basic framework which might be extended ([@sec:objective] and [@sec:extensibility]) by academic researchers and programmers. It thus should also be free.^[Free as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”]
The detailed licensing terms are left to the offer but it should allow users to solve their problems the way they need and, eventually, to modify and improve the tool to suit their needs. If they cannot program themselves, they should have the freedom to hire somebody to do it for them.
