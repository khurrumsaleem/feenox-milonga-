## Execution {#sec:execution}

It is mandatory to be able to execute the tool remotely, either with a direct action from the user or from a high-level workflow which could be triggered by a human or by an automated script. 
The tool shall provide a mean to perform parametric computations by varying one or more problem parameters in a certain prescribed way (for instance to perform iterations defined by another outer-loop optimization tool).
