## Documentation {#sec:documentation}

Documentation should be complete and cover both the user and the developer point of view. It should contain a user manual adequate for both reference and tutorial purposes. Other forms of simplified documentation such as quick reference cards or video tutorials are not mandatory but highly recommended. Since the tool should be extendable ([@sec:extensibility]), there should be a separate development manual covering the programming design and implementation and how to extend and add new features.
Also, as non-trivial mathematics which should be verified ([@sec:verification]) are expected, an explanation what equations are taken into account and how they are solved is required.

It should be possible to make the full documentation available online in a way that it can be both printed in hard copy and accessed easily from a mobile device. Users modifying the tool to suit their own needs should be able to modify the associated documentation as well.
