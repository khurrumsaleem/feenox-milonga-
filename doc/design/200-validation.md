## Validation

For each industrial application of the tool there should be a documented procedure to perform a set of validation tests. This procedure should be based on existing industry standards regarding verification and validation such as ASME or IAEA. There should be a procedure for each type of physical problem (thermal, mechanical, thermomechanical, nuclear, etc.) and for each problem type when a new

 * geometry,
 * mesh type,
 * material model,
 * boundary condition,
 * data interpolation scheme
 
\noindent or any other particular application-dependent feature is needed.

A report following the V&V procedure defined above should be prepared and signed by a responsible engineer in a case-by-case basis for each particular field of application of the tool. Verification can be performed against

 * known analytical results, and/or
 * other already-validated tools following the same standards, and/or
 * experimental results.
