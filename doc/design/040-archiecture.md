# Architecture {#sec:architecture}

The tool must be aimed at being executed unattended on remote cloud servers which are expected to have a mainstream^[as of 2021] architecture regarding operating system (UNIX-like GNU/Linux variants) and hardware stack (number and type of CPUs, number and type of memory caches, disk and RAM storage size, etc.). It should successfully run on virtual and/or containerized servers using standard compilers, dependencies and libraries already available in the repositories of current operating systems distributions. Preference should be given to open source compilers, dependencies and libraries. Small problems might be executed in a single host but large problems ought to be split through several server instances depending on the processing and memory requirements. The computational implementation should adhere to open and well-established standards.
