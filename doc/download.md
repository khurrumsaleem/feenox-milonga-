 * Be aware that FeenoX is a backend. It **does not have a GUI**. Read the [documentation](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/), especially the [description](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/feenox-desc.html) and the [FAQs](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/FAQ.html). Ask for help on the [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/discussions).
 * Binaries are provided as statically-linked executables for convenience. They do not support MUMPS nor MPI and have only basic optimization flags. Please compile from source for high-end applications. See [detailed compilatation instructions](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/compilation.html).
 * Try to avoid Windows as much as you can. The binaries are provided as transitional packages for people that for some reason still use such an outdated, anachronous, awful and invasive operating system. They are compiled with [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) and have no support whatsoever. Really, really, **get rid of Windows ASAP**.
