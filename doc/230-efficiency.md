It is mandatory to be able to execute the tool automatically in a remote server. 
The computational resources needed from this server, i.e. costs measured in

 * CPU/GPU time
 * random-access memory
 * long-term storage
 * etc.
 
needed to solve a problem should be comparable to other similar state-of-the-art cloud-based script-friendly finite-element tools.
