As required in the previous section, it is mandatory to be able to execute the tool on one or more remote servers. 
The computational resources needed from this server, i.e. costs measured in

 * CPU/GPU time
 * random-access memory
 * long-term storage
 * etc.
 
needed to solve a problem should be comparable to other similar state-of-the-art cloud-based script-friendly finite-element tools.
