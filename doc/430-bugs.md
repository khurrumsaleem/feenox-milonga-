A system to allow developers and users to report bugs and errors and to suggest improvements should be provided. If applicable, bug reports should be tracked, addressed and documented. User-provided suggestions might go into the back log or TO-DO list if appropriate.

Here, "bug and errors" mean failure to

 * compile on supported architectures,
 * run (unexpected run-time errors, segmentation faults, etc.)
 * return a correct result
