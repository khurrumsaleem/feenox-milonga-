Let us solve the linear elasticity benchmark problem [NAFEMS\ LE10](https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/p18/) “Thick plate pressure.” Assuming a proper mesh has already been created in Gmsh, note how well the FeenoX input file matches the problem statement:

![The NAFEMS LE10 problem statement and the corresponding FeenoX input](nafems-le10-problem-input.svg){width=100%}

```{.feenox include="nafems-le10.fee"}
```

The problem asks for the normal stress in the\ $y$ direction $\sigma_y$ at point\ “D,” which is what FeenoX writes (and nothing else, *rule of economy*):

```terminal
$ feenox nafems-le10.fee 
sigma_y @ D =   -5.38136        MPa
$ 
```
