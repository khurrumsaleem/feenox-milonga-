It is mandatory to be able to execute the tool remotely, either with a direct action from the user or from a high-level workflow which could be triggered by a human or by an automated script. The calling party should be able to monitor the status during run time and get the returned error level after finishing the execution.

The tool shall provide a mean to perform parametric computations by varying one or more problem parameters in a certain prescribed way such that it can be used as an inner solver for an outer-loop optimization tool. In this regard, it is desirable if the tool could compute scalar values such that the figure of merit being optimized (maximum temperature, total weight, total heat flux, minimum natural frequency, maximum displacement, maximum von\ Mises stress, etc.) is already available without needing further post-processing.
