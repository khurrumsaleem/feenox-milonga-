l = 0.5*303e-3   # [ m ] cantilever length
d = 1.948e-3     # [ m ] diameter

# material properties for copper
mass = 0.5*8.02e-3       # [ kg ] total mass (half the measured because of the experimental disposition)
volume = pi*(0.5*d)^2*l
rho = mass/volume        # [ kg / m^3 ] density = mass (measured) / volume 
E = 2*66.2e9             # [ Pa ] Young modulus (twice because the factor-two error)
nu = 0                   # Poissonâ€™s ratio (does not appear in Euler-Bernoulli)

# compute analytical solution
# first compute the first five roots ok cosh(kl)*cos(kl)+1 
VECTOR kl[5]
kl[i] = root(cosh(t)*cos(t)+1, t, 3*i-2,3*i+1)

# then compute the frequencies according to Euler-Bernoulli
# note that we need to use SI inside the square root
A = pi * (d/2)^2
I = pi/4 * (d/2)^4

VECTOR f_euler[5]
f_euler[i] = 1/(2*pi) * kl(i)^2 * sqrt((E * I)/(rho * A * l^4))

# now compute the modes numerically with FEM
# note that each mode is duplicated as it is degenerated
