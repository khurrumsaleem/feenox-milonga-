# FeenoX docs

This directory contains the FeenoX documentation.
Everything is created out of the source files which are a mixture of Bash, M4 and Markdown.

Execute (and see) `make.sh`

# Syntax Highlight

Execute `syntax-kate.sh` to get a katepart XML file with the syntax highlight rules that can be used for Kate and for Pandoc. Also, `syntax-tex.sh` can create the language definition for LaTeX's listings package (which can in turn be used by Pandoc).
