# What

FeenoX is a [cloud-first](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#cloud-first) [Unix](./README4hackers.md) stand-alone program (i.e. something your run, not something you have to link existing code against) that reads an [engineering-related problem](./README4engineers.md) in a plain-text file containing definitions and instructions. This program then solves the problem and, eventually, writes the outputs which the input file requests with explicit instructions (and nothing if nothing is asked for) and returns back to the Unix shell.
It can be seen as a Unix filter (or as a transfer function)

```include
doc/transfer.md
```

which, when zoomed in, acts as a "glue layer" between a mesher (Gmsh) and a library for solving large sparse problems (PETSc) which for linear elastic looks as follows:

The design responds to a [Software Requirement Specifications](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/srs.html) that acts as a "request for quotations" of a computational engineering tool that should satisfy some fictitious (but plausible) requirements.
The [Software Design Specifications](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html) explains how FeenoX addresses each requirement of the SRS.

In principle, even though FeenoX can solve [generic numerical problems](https://seamplex.com/feenox/examples/examples/basic.html) and [systems of ordinary differential/algebraic eq1uations](https://seamplex.com/feenox/examples/daes.html), its main focus is on solving partial differential equations using the finite element method---eventually [in parallel using the MPI standard](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#sec:scalability).
The current version can solve

```include
doc/examples-list.md
```

Two of the supported PDEs are related to neutron transport.
There is a PhD thesis (in Spanish only) that discusses the design and implementation of FeenoX in view of core-level neutronics.

But more importantly, FeenoX provides a mean to add new types of PDEs by adding a new subdirectory to the [`src/pdes`](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/tree/main/src/pdes) [directory of the source tree and then re-bootstrapping, re-configuring and re-compiling the code](https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html#sec:extensibility). See below for further details.

Since in FeenoX's input file everything is an expression, the code is especially suited for [verification using the method of manufactured solutions](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/tree/main/tests/mms).

# How

By leveraging the Unix programming philosophy to come up with a cloud-first tool suitable to serve as the back end of web-based interfaces such as CAEplex.

The fact that FeenoX is a program and not a library is a deliberate decision discussed in the [Software Design Specifications](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/sds.html).

A mathematical framework with C entry points that tell it what to put in the global stiffness matrix, residuals, etc.




FeenoX provides a general mathematical framework to solve PDEs with a bunch of entry points (as C functions) where new types of PDEs (e.g. electromagnetism, fluid mechanics, etc.) can be added to the set of what FeenoX can solve. FeenoX will provide means to

  - parse the input file, handle command-line arguments, read mesh files, assign variables, evaluate conditionals, write results, etc.

    ```feenox
    PROBLEM laplace 2D
    READ_MESH square-$1.msh
    [...]
    WRITE_RESULTS FORMAT vtk
    ```
    
  - handle material properties given as algebraic expressions involving pointwise-defined functions of space, temperature, time, etc.
    
    ```feenox
    MATERIAL steel     E=210e3*(1-1e-3*(T(x,y,z)-20))   nu=0.3
    MATERIAL aluminum  E=69e3                           nu=7/25
    ```
    
  - read problem-specific boundary conditions as algebraic expressions
    
    ```feenox
    sigma = 5.670374419e-8  # W m^2 / K^4 as in wikipedia
    e = 0.98      # non-dimensional
    T0 = 1000     # K
    Tinf = 300    # K

    BC left  T=T0
    BC right q=sigma*e*(Tinf^4-T(x,y,z)^4)
    ```

  - access shape functions and its derivatives evaluated eitehr at Gauss points or at arbitrary locations for computing elementary contributions to
     * stiffness matrix
     * mass matrix
     * right-hand side vector
    
  - solve the discretized equations using the appropriate [PETSc](https://petsc.org/)/[SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es/) objects, i.e.
    * [KSP](https://petsc.org/release/manual/ksp/) for linear static problems
    * [SNES](https://petsc.org/release/manual/snes/) for non-linear static problems
    * [TS](https://petsc.org/release/manual/ts/) for transient problems
    * [EPS](https://slepc.upv.es/documentation/current/docs/manualpages/EPS/index.html) for eigenvalue problems

This general framework constitutes the bulk of [FeenoXâ€™s source code](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox).
The particular functions that implement each problem type are located in subdirectories [`src/pdes`](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/tree/main/src/pdes), namely

```include
doc/pdes.md
```
      
Researchers with both knowledge of mathematical theory of finite elements and programming skills might add support for other PDES by using one of these directories (say [`laplace`](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/tree/main/src/pdes/laplace)) as a template and

 #. replace every occurrence of `laplace` in symbol names with the name of the new PDE
 #. modify the initialization functions in `init.c` and set 
     * the names of the unknowns
     * the names of the materials
     * the mathematical type and properties of problem 
     * etc.
 #. modify the contents of the elemental matrices in `bulk.c` in the FEM formulation of the problem being added
 #. modify the contents of how the boundary conditions are parsed and set in `bc.c`
 #. re-run `autogen.sh`, `./configure` and `make` to get a FeenoX executable with support for the new PDE.

See the [programming guide](doc/programming.md) for details.

See hackers for more technical details about how FeenoX works.



# Why

The world is already full of finite-element programs and every day a grad student creates a new one from scratch.
So why adding FeenoX to the already-crowded space of FEA tools?


Because there are either

 a. libraries which need code to use them, 
 b. end-user programs which need a GUI

FeenoX sits in the middle:

 * to solve a problem one needs to prepare an input file (not a script) which is read at run-time, not code which calls a library
 * these input files can expand generic command-line options using Bash syntax as `$1`, `$2`, etc, which allows for parametric or optimization loops driven by higher-level scripts
 * for solving PDEs, the input file has to refer to at least one Gmsh `.msh` file that defines the domain where the PDE is solved
 * the material properties and boundary condition are defined using physical groups and not individual nodes nor elements, so the input file is independent of the mesh and thus can be tracked with Git to increase traceability and repeatability
 * it uses the Unix philosophy which, among others, separates policy from mechanism and thus FeenoX is a natural choice for web-based interfaces like CAEplex
 

See [FeenoX for hackers](./README4hackers.md) for another explanation about why FeenoX is different from other computational tools.
